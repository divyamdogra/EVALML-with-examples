# EVALML-with-examples
<h4> EvalML provides a simple, unified interface for building machine learning models, using those models to generate insights and to make accurate predictions. EvalML provides access to multiple modeling libraries under the same API. EvalML supports a variety of supervised machine learning problem types including regression, binary classification and multiclass classification. Custom objective functions let users phrase their search for a model directly in terms of what they value. Above all we’ve aimed to make EvalML stable and performant, with ML performance testing on every release. </h4>

<h3> Data Checks capabilities and more </h3>
EvalML's data checks can catch common problems with your data prior to modeling, before they cause model quality problems or mysterious bugs and stack traces. Current data checks include a simple approach to detecting target leakage, where the model is given access to information during training which won’t be available at prediction-time, detection of invalid datatypes, high class imbalance, highly null columns, constant columns, and columns which are likely an ID and not useful for modeling.
