# EVALML-with-examples
<h3> EvalML provides a simple, unified interface for building machine learning models, using those models to generate insights and to make accurate predictions. EvalML provides access to multiple modeling libraries under the same API. EvalML supports a variety of supervised machine learning problem types including regression, binary classification and multiclass classification. Custom objective functions let users phrase their search for a model directly in terms of what they value. Above all weâ€™ve aimed to make EvalML stable and performant, with ML performance testing on every release. </h3>
